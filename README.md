## Compare TypeScript and JavaScript

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning **type checking happens at runtime**. This offers flexibility but can lead to runtime errors that are hard to catch during development. TypeScript, on the other hand, is a syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional **static typing**. This means you write JavaScript code with added type annotations, and TypeScript's compiler checks for type errors *before* your code runs. Ultimately, TypeScript code is compiled down to plain JavaScript, which can then be executed by any JavaScript runtime.

---

## Why to Learn TypeScript

Learning TypeScript offers significant advantages, especially for large-scale applications:

* **Early Error Detection:** Catches type-related bugs during development (**compile-time**) rather than at runtime, leading to more robust code.
* **Improved Code Readability and Maintainability:** Explicit types act as documentation, making code easier to understand, refactor, and maintain, especially in team environments.
* **Enhanced Tooling:** Provides superior autocompletion, refactoring, and navigation features in IDEs, boosting developer productivity.
* **Better Collaboration:** Reduces miscommunication and errors when multiple developers work on the same codebase due to clear type contracts.
* **Scalability:** Makes it easier to manage complex applications as they grow, by enforcing structure and consistency.

---

## TypeScript is Not What You Think

Many newcomers have misconceptions about TypeScript:

* **It's not a new language entirely:** It's JavaScript with added type features. All valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript.
* **It doesn't run in the browser:** TypeScript code needs to be compiled ("transpiled") into JavaScript before it can be executed by browsers or Node.js.
* **It doesn't guarantee bug-free code:** While it eliminates a class of type-related errors, logical errors or runtime issues unrelated to types can still occur.
* **Types are erased at runtime:** The type annotations you add in TypeScript are purely for compile-time checking and are removed during the compilation process, resulting in standard JavaScript.

## How to Install TypeScript

TypeScript is installed as a Node.js package using npm (Node Package Manager). You typically install it globally to make the `tsc` (TypeScript Compiler) command available in your terminal.

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

## Your First Intro to TypeScript Docs
After installation, you can compile a TypeScript file (.ts) into a JavaScript file (.js) using the tsc command.

For example, if you have a file named hello.ts:

```bash
// hello.ts
function greet(name: string) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet("World");
```

You can compile it by running:
```bash
tsc hello.ts
```
This will generate hello.js in the same directory.

## Number, Boolean, and Type Inference
TypeScript supports primitive types like number, boolean, string, null, undefined, symbol, and bigint.

Type inference is one of TypeScript's powerful features. When you declare a variable and initialize it immediately, TypeScript often "infers" its type without you explicitly stating it.

```bash
let age = 30; // TypeScript infers 'age' is of type 'number'
let isActive = true; // TypeScript infers 'isActive' is of type 'boolean'
let userName = "Alice"; // TypeScript infers 'userName' is of type 'string'
```

While inference is helpful, explicit type annotations improve readability and ensure strictness, especially for function parameters and return types.

## Don't Use ANY
The any type is TypeScript's escape hatch from the type system. A variable declared with any can hold any type of value, and TypeScript will perform no type checking on it.

```bash
let myValue: any = "hello";
myValue = 10;
myValue.toUpperCase(); // No error, even if myValue is a number at runtime
```

While `any` can be useful for migrating legacy JavaScript or dealing with external libraries without type definitions, its overuse defeats the purpose of TypeScript. It essentially turns off type checking for that variable, reintroducing the very problems TypeScript aims to solve. Always strive to use more specific types.

---

## Do You Really Know Functions?

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens and can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. TypeScript enhances this by allowing you to explicitly define the types of function parameters and their return values. This ensures that functions are called with the correct arguments and that their output is as expected.

---

## A Better Way to Write Functions

Explicitly typing function parameters and return values makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.

```typescript
// Function with typed parameters and return type
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}

// Arrow function with typed parameters and return type
const multiply = (x: number, y: number): number => {
    return x * y;
};
```
This clarity helps prevent common errors like passing a string when a number is expected, or expecting a number back when the function might return undefined.

### Bad Behavior of Objects
JavaScript objects are highly flexible. You can add, remove, or modify properties at runtime, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and runtime errors if not managed carefully. TypeScript helps by allowing you to define the shape of an object, ensuring that it adheres to a specific structure.

```JavaScript

// In JavaScript, this is fine but prone to errors:
let user = { name: "John" };
user.age = 30; // Adding new property
user.name = 123; // Changing type of existing property

```
TypeScript introduces mechanisms like interfaces and type aliases to define fixed structures for objects, preventing such "bad behavior" at compile-time.

## Type Aliases
Type aliases allow you to create a new name for any type. This is particularly useful for complex object types, union types, or tuples, making your code more readable and reusable.

```TypeScript

type Point = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
};

type ID = string | number;

let coordinate: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
let userId: ID = "abc-123";
```
Type aliases do not create new types; they simply provide a new name for an existing type.

## READONLY and Optional Properties
TypeScript allows you to define properties within interfaces or type aliases as readonly or optional.

readonly properties: Once assigned an initial value, these properties cannot be reassigned. This is useful for ensuring immutability.

```TypeScript

type User = {
    readonly id: string;
    name: string;
};

let user: User = { id: "123", name: "Alice" };
// user.id = "456"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.
Optional properties: Marked with a ?, these properties may or may not be present on an object.

TypeScript

type Product = {
    name: string;
    price: number;
    description?: string; // description is optional
};

let laptop: Product = { name: "Laptop", price: 1200 };
let phone: Product = { name: "Phone", price: 800, description: "Smartphone" };
```
## Array
Arrays in TypeScript are typed, meaning you specify the type of elements they can contain.

```TypeScript

let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let names: Array<string> = ["Alice", "Bob"]; // Alternative syntax using generics

// Array of objects
type Person = { name: string; age: number };
let people: Person[] = [{ name: "Charlie", age: 25 }];
```

This ensures that you don't accidentally add elements of the wrong type to an array.

## Union Types in TS
Union types allow a variable or parameter to hold values of several different types. You define a union type using the | (pipe) symbol.

```TypeScript

let mixedId: string | number;
mixedId = "user123";
mixedId = 456;
// mixedId = true; // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.

function printId(id: string | number) {
    console.log(`ID: ${id}`);
}
```
Union types are fundamental for handling situations where a value can legitimately be one of a few different types.

## Tuples
Tuples are a special type of array in TypeScript that allows you to express an array with a fixed number of elements, where each element has a known type, but the types can be different.

```TypeScript

// A tuple representing a [statusCode, statusMessage] pair
let httpResponse: [number, string];
httpResponse = [200, "OK"];
// httpResponse = ["OK", 200]; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
// httpResponse = [200, "OK", "extra"]; // Error: Source has 3 elements, but target allows 2.
```

Tuples are useful when you need to represent a structured list of values with specific positions and types.

## Enums
Enums (enumerations) allow you to define a set of named constants. They make it easier to work with a set of distinct values, improving readability and preventing errors from using magic strings or numbers.

```TypeScript

// Numeric Enum (default: starts from 0)
enum Direction {
    Up,      // 0
    Down,    // 1
    Left,    // 2
    Right    // 3
}

let playerDirection: Direction = Direction.Up;
console.log(playerDirection); // Output: 0

// String Enum
enum Status {
    Success = "SUCCESS",
    Failure = "FAILURE",
    Pending = "PENDING"
}

let operationStatus: Status = Status.Success;
console.log(operationStatus); // Output: SUCCESS
```
Enums provide a way to create more expressive and type-safe code when dealing with a fixed set of options.

## Interface
Interfaces are a core concept in TypeScript for defining the shape of objects. They act as contracts that objects must adhere to. An interface only exists at compile-time and is completely removed from the JavaScript output.

```TypeScript

interface User {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
    email?: string; // Optional property
    greet(): string; // Method signature
}

function printUserDetails(user: User) {
    console.log(`Name: ${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`);
    console.log(`Age: ${user.age}`);
    if (user.email) {
        console.log(`Email: ${user.email}`);
    }
    console.log(user.greet());
}

let person: User = {
    firstName: "Jane",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30,
    greet: () => "Hello!"
};

printUserDetails(person);
```
Interfaces can also describe function types, indexable types, and class types. They are crucial for creating clear, consistent data structures.

## Interface vs Type
Both interface and type aliases can be used to define the shape of objects and functions. However, there are key differences:


```markdown
| Feature                  |Interface                                     | Type Alias |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Declaration              | `interface MyInterface { ... }`              | `type MyType = { ..`                       |
| Extensibility            | Can be extended by other interfaces/classes  | Can extend other types (`&`) but cannot be |
|                          | (`extends`) and can be reopened to add new   | reopened.                                  |
|                          | properties later (declaration merging).      |                                            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|

|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Implementation           | Classes can implement interfaces.            | Classes cannot implement type aliases      |
|                          |                                              | directly (though they can implement the    |
|                          |                                              | shape defined by a type alias).            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
```
In modern TypeScript, type aliases are generally more flexible as they can represent any type, while interface is often preferred for defining object shapes, especially when declaration merging or traditional object-oriented implements behavior is desired.

## How to Setup TypeScript for Real Projects
Setting up TypeScript for a real project involves more than just installing the compiler. The ```tsconfig.json``` file is central to configuring how TypeScript compiles your project.

### A typical setup includes:
#### tsconfig.json:
 This file specifies root files, compiler options (like target ES version, module system, strict mode), and output directories.

#### Build Tools:
 Integrating TypeScript with build tools like Webpack, Rollup, or Vite using appropriate loaders (e.g., ts-loader for Webpack) to compile .ts files as part of the build process.

#### Linters:
 Using ESLint with TypeScript plugins to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues beyond just type errors.

#### Testing Frameworks: 
Configuring testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Vitest) to work with TypeScript.

## Private and Public Modifiers
In TypeScript classes, private and public are access modifiers that control the visibility of class members (properties and methods).

### public (default): 
Members are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class. If no modifier is specified, a member is public by default.

### private: 
Members are only accessible from within the class where they are defined. They cannot be accessed or modified from instances of the class or from derived classes.

````TypeScript

class Car {
    public brand: string;
    private speed: number = 0;

    constructor(brand: string) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    public accelerate(amount: number) {
        this.speed += amount;
        console.log(`${this.brand} is accelerating. Current speed: ${this.speed}`);
    }

    private getSpeed(): number {
        return this.speed;
    }
}

let myCar = new Car("Toyota");
console.log(myCar.brand); // Accessible (public)
myCar.accelerate(50); // Accessible (public)
// console.log(myCar.speed); // Error: Property 'speed' is private
// myCar.getSpeed(); // Error: Property 'getSpeed' is private
```
## Getters and Setters
Getters and setters are special methods within a class that allow you to control access to properties. They provide a way to execute custom logic when a property is read (getter) or written to (setter), encapsulating the internal representation of data.

```TypeScript

class Circle {
    private _radius: number;

    constructor(radius: number) {
        this._radius = radius;
    }

    // Getter for radius
    get radius(): number {
        return this._radius;
    }

    // Setter for radius with validation
    set radius(newRadius: number) {
        if (newRadius <= 0) {
            console.error("Radius must be positive.");
            return;
        }
        this._radius = newRadius;
    }

    get area(): number {
        return Math.PI * this._radius * this._radius;
    }
}

let myCircle = new Circle(5);
console.log(myCircle.radius); // Calls the getter
myCircle.radius = 10; // Calls the setter
console.log(myCircle.area); // Calls getter for radius internally
myCircle.radius = -2; // Calls setter, logs error
```
Getters and setters provide a controlled interface for interacting with private data.

## Protected Modifier
The protected access modifier is similar to private in that it restricts direct access from outside the class instance. However, protected members are accessible from within derived (sub) classes.

```TypeScript

class Animal {
    protected name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    protected makeSound(sound: string) {
        console.log(`${this.name} says ${sound}`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name: string) {
        super(name);
    }

    bark() {
        this.makeSound("Woof!"); // Accessible in derived class
    }

    getName() {
        return this.name; // Accessible in derived class
    }
}

let myDog = new Dog("Buddy");
myDog.bark();
console.log(myDog.getName());
// console.log(myDog.name); // Error: Property 'name' is protected
```
protected is useful for creating class hierarchies where certain internal details should be shared among related classes but not exposed to the outside world.

## Why Interface is Important
Interfaces are paramount in TypeScript for several reasons:

Defining Contracts: They establish clear contracts for the shape of objects, ensuring that different parts of your application (or different teams) agree on data structures.

Enforcing Consistency: They enforce that objects conform to a specific structure, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors due to missing or mistyped properties.

Improving Readability and Maintainability: Interfaces act as self-documenting code, making it easier to understand the expected data flow and object structures.

Enabling Polymorphism: Classes can implement interfaces, allowing them to be treated interchangeably based on the interface they implement, promoting flexible and extensible designs.

Facilitating Collaboration: When working in teams, interfaces provide a shared understanding of data models, reducing integration issues.

Enhancing Tooling: IDEs leverage interfaces to provide powerful autocompletion, refactoring, and error checking.

## Generics in Array and Arrow Functions
Generics provide a way to create reusable components that can work with a variety of types rather than a single one. They allow you to write flexible functions, classes, and interfaces that adapt to the types they operate on while still maintaining type safety.

Generics with Arrays: The Array<T> syntax is a generic type, where T is a placeholder for the type of elements in the array.

``` TypeScript

let numbers: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];
let names: Array<string> = ["Alice", "Bob"];
Generics with Arrow Functions (and regular functions): You can define generic functions by placing the type parameter (e.g., <T>) before the function's parameters.

TypeScript

// Generic arrow function
const identity = <T>(arg: T): T => {
    return arg;
};

let result1 = identity<string>("hello"); // T is inferred as string
let result2 = identity<number>(123);     // T is inferred as number

// Generic function to get the first element of an array
function getFirstElement<T>(arr: T[]): T | undefined {
    return arr.length > 0 ? arr[0] : undefined;
}

let firstNum = getFirstElement([10, 20, 30]); // T is number
let firstStr = getFirstElement(["a", "b", "c"]); // T is string
```
Generics are essential for building type-safe and flexible libraries and components.

## Generic Classes
Just like functions, classes can also be generic. This allows you to create classes that operate on types that are specified when the class is instantiated.

```TypeScript

class Box<T> {
    private value: T;

    constructor(value: T) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    getValue(): T {
        return this.value;
    }

    setValue(newValue: T) {
        this.value = newValue;
    }
}

let stringBox = new Box<string>("TypeScript");
console.log(stringBox.getValue()); // "TypeScript"
stringBox.setValue("Generics");

let numberBox = new Box<number>(123);
console.log(numberBox.getValue()); // 123
numberBox.setValue(456);
// numberBox.setValue("abc"); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```
Generic classes are powerful for creating data structures (like lists, queues, trees) that can hold elements of any specified type while maintaining type safety.

## Type Narrowing
Type narrowing is the process by which TypeScript refines the type of a variable within a certain code block (e.g., an if statement, switch statement, or try-catch block). It allows TypeScript to understand that a variable, which might have a broader type initially, now has a more specific type based on runtime checks.

```TypeScript

function printLength(value: string | string[]) {
    if (typeof value === 'string') {
        // Inside this block, 'value' is narrowed to 'string'
        console.log(value.length);
    } else {
        // Inside this block, 'value' is narrowed to 'string[]'
        console.log(value.length);
    }
}
```
Type narrowing is crucial for working with union types and ensuring type safety in conditional logic.

## The in Operator Narrowing
The in operator is a useful way to perform type narrowing, especially when dealing with objects that might have different properties. It checks if a property exists on an object.

```TypeScript

interface Dog {
    bark(): void;
    breed: string;
}

interface Cat {
    meow(): void;
    color: string;
}

function makeSound(animal: Dog | Cat) {
    if ('bark' in animal) {
        // 'animal' is narrowed to 'Dog'
        animal.bark();
        console.log(`It's a dog of breed: ${animal.breed}`);
    } else {
        // 'animal' is narrowed to 'Cat'
        animal.meow();
        console.log(`It's a cat of color: ${animal.color}`);
    }
}
```
This allows you to safely access properties or call methods that are specific to one type within a union.

## Instanceof and Type Predicates
instanceof Narrowing: The instanceof operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a particular class. TypeScript uses this to narrow the type of a variable.

```TypeScript

class Bird {
    fly() { console.log("Flying..."); }
}

class Fish {
    swim() { console.log("Swimming..."); }
}

function move(animal: Bird | Fish) {
    if (animal instanceof Bird) {
        // 'animal' is narrowed to 'Bird'
        animal.fly();
    } else {
        // 'animal' is narrowed to 'Fish'
        animal.swim();
    }
}
```
Type Predicates (User-Defined Type Guards): Sometimes, typeof or instanceof aren't sufficient for complex type narrowing. Type predicates allow you to define custom functions that tell TypeScript how to narrow a type. A type predicate function has a return type of parameterName is Type.

```TypeScript

interface Car {
    drive(): void;
}

interface Boat {
    sail(): void;
}

function isCar(vehicle: Car | Boat): vehicle is Car {
    return (vehicle as Car).drive !== undefined;
}

function operateVehicle(vehicle: Car | Boat) {
    if (isCar(vehicle)) {
        // 'vehicle' is narrowed to 'Car'
        vehicle.drive();
    } else {
        // 'vehicle' is narrowed to 'Boat'
        vehicle.sail();
    }
}
```
Type predicates are powerful for creating highly specific and reusable type guards.

## Discriminated Union and Exhaustiveness Checking with never
Discriminated Unions: This is a powerful pattern for working with union types where each type in the union has a common, literal property (the "discriminant") that TypeScript can use to distinguish between them.

```TypeScript

interface Square {
    kind: "square"; // Discriminant property
    size: number;
}

interface Circle {
    kind: "circle"; // Discriminant property
    radius: number;
}

interface Triangle {
    kind: "triangle"; // Discriminant property
    base: number;
    height: number;
}

type Shape = Square | Circle | Triangle;

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
    switch (shape.kind) {
        case "square":
            return shape.size * shape.size;
        case "circle":
            return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
        case "triangle":
            return 0.5 * shape.base * shape.height;
    }
}
```
TypeScript can intelligently narrow the type of shape within each case block based on the kind property.

Exhaustiveness Checking with never: The never type represents the type of values that never occur. It's often used for exhaustiveness checking in switch statements with discriminated unions. If you have a switch statement that doesn't cover all possible cases of a discriminated union, you can use never to make TypeScript warn you about missing cases.

```TypeScript

function getAreaWithExhaustivenessCheck(shape: Shape) {
    switch (shape.kind) {
        case "square":
            return shape.size * shape.size;
        case "circle":
            return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
        // case "triangle": // If this case was missing
        //     return 0.5 * shape.base * shape.height;
        default:
            // This line should ideally never be reached if all cases are handled.
            // If a new shape is added to 'Shape' but not handled here,
            // TypeScript will error because 'shape' could still be 'Triangle',
            // which is not assignable to 'never'.
            const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
            return _exhaustiveCheck;
    }
}
```
This pattern ensures that you handle all possible variants of a union type, making your code more robust and preventing future bugs when new types are added.
